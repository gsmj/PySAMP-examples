# PySAMP-examples
A set of different gamemode templates for the PySAMP

## Gamemodes:

### Empty
- An empty gamemode with the **Player class registry**

### PyLarc
- A freeroam gamemode for SA-MP 0.3.
- Containts example of **Player class registry**

### Timerterst
- A simple gamemode that shows how timers work

### LVDM
- A deathmatch gamemode
- Containts example commands

> [!TIP]
> Note that some gamemodes contain a modified player class, this allows us to get the same class instance in events  /functions and not lose our class instance attributes.
> You should definitely use this method in your own gamemodes.
